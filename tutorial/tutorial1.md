This example defines a single text field and lists the basic attributes of a field. Experiment changing the values to see what effect they have on both the output value and the display of the field. You can also experiment changing the `type` to `textarea`.

Try making `FIELD1` a required field by changing `required` from `false` to `true`. Notice the change in appearance of the field? Now clear the value from the field and notice what happens to the button. It is only possible to click a `FormButton` when the form contains valid data.
