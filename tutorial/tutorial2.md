In this example we are defining a relationship between text fields.

We are creating a rule that controls the visibility of the text field `TEXT` that is dependant upon the value of the checkbox field `CHECKBOX`. Rule definitions can test multiple fields and each field can look for multiple values.

Try changing `is` to `isNot` and notice that the behaviour changes. The text field is now visible when the checkbox is **not** checked.
